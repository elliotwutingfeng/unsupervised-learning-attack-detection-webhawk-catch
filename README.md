## About

Webhawk is an open source machine learning powered Web attack detection tool. It uses your web logs as training data. Webhawk offers a REST API that makes it easy to integrate within your SoC ecosystem. To train a detection model and use it as an extra security level in your organization, follow the following steps.

## Setup

### Using a Python virtual env

```shell
python -m venv webhawk_venv
source webhawk_venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Create a settings.conf file

Copy settings_template.conf file to settings.conf and fill it with the required parameters as the following.

```shell
[MODEL]
model:MODELS/the_model_you_will_train.pkl
[FEATURES]
features:length,params_number,return_code,size,upper_cases,lower_cases,special_chars,url_depth
```

## Unsupervised detection Usage

### Run the unsupervised detection script

Encoding is automatic for the unsupervised mode. You just need to run the catch.py script.
Get inspired from this example:

```shell
python catch.py -l ./SAMPLE_DATA/raw-http-logs-samples/aug_sep_oct_2021.log -t apache -j 10000 -v -e 5000 -s 5
```

## Used sample data

The data you will find in SAMPLE_DATA folder comes from<br>
